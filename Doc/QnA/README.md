Here are **20 more deep Q&A questions** to help you prepare for your presentation round:  

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Advanced Technical Questions**  

### **1. How does your AI model distinguish between a legitimate and a phishing website?**  
**A:** "We use a multi-layered approach:  
- **Lexical Analysis** â€“ Detects misspelled domains (e.g., `paypa1.com` instead of `paypal.com`).  
- **Visual Similarity Matching** â€“ Compares site layout and elements with known phishing templates.  
- **SSL Certificate Inspection** â€“ Checks for self-signed or invalid certificates.  
- **Behavioral Analysis** â€“ Detects auto-redirects, hidden input fields, and fake login forms."  

### **2. How do you prevent false positives in phishing detection?**  
**A:** "We minimize false positives using:  
1. **Whitelisting trusted websites** to avoid misclassifications.  
2. **Machine learning-based confidence scoring**, where only high-probability phishing sites are blocked.  
3. **User feedback integration**, allowing users to report incorrect detections and refine the model."  

### **3. How does your extension handle phishing sites that dynamically change their content?**  
**A:** "We use **real-time feature extraction** and **heuristic-based detection** to detect phishing attempts dynamically. The AI model analyzes live website behavior rather than just static URLs."  

### **4. Can your extension detect phishing websites that use HTTPS and have valid SSL certificates?**  
**A:** "Yes, many phishing sites now use HTTPS to appear legitimate. Our AI model does not rely on SSL alone but also examines **domain reputation, content structure, and user behavior tracking**."  

### **5. How does your solution handle homograph attacks? (e.g., â€˜paypal.comâ€™ vs. â€˜Ñ€Ð°ypal.comâ€™ using Cyrillic characters)**  
**A:** "We detect homograph attacks using **Unicode character analysis** and **Levenshtein distance** to compare URLs against known legitimate domains."  

### **6. How does the VirusTotal API enhance phishing detection?**  
**A:** "VirusTotal aggregates results from multiple cybersecurity firms and threat databases. We use it to:  
- **Cross-check suspicious URLs** against known malicious domains.  
- **Enhance AI model training** by incorporating verified phishing data.  
- **Provide additional metadata** like malware associations or spam history."  

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Security & Privacy Questions**  

### **7. What measures have you implemented to prevent your extension from being exploited by hackers?**  
**A:** "We have:  
- **Strict Content Security Policy (CSP)** to prevent code injection attacks.  
- **No external scripts** to avoid dependencies that could be compromised.  
- **Code integrity verification** to prevent unauthorized modifications."  

### **8. How do you ensure that your extension does not compromise user privacy?**  
**A:** "We do not collect or store browsing history. URL analysis happens **locally**, and only anonymous queries are sent to VirusTotal."  

### **9. How do you handle phishing emails that use legitimate-looking sender addresses?**  
**A:** "We analyze:  
- **Email headers** to detect spoofing techniques (SPF, DKIM, DMARC checks).  
- **Embedded links** for phishing indicators.  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to detect social engineering patterns."  

### **10. How does your extension prevent attackers from bypassing detection by using shortened URLs (e.g., bit.ly, tinyurl)?**  
**A:** "We expand shortened URLs and analyze the final destination before allowing access."  

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Performance & Scalability Questions**  

### **11. How does your extension ensure minimal impact on browser performance?**  
**A:** "We use:  
- **Asynchronous processing** to prevent blocking the browser.
